# Known limitations — 0.1.0-rc.1

Each line is a limitation a user or operator can run into. Classification follows the
directive's blocker taxonomy: `SIGNING_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `HARDWARE_REQUIRED`,
`REMOTE_ACCESS_REQUIRED`, `LICENSE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

- SIGNING_REQUIRED — builds are unsigned: Windows SmartScreen warns on first run, and the
  updater only checks and notifies; installation is manual until a code-signing
  certificate is configured (ADR-012).
- AUTH_REQUIRED — NASA FIRMS needs a free MAP_KEY; without it the fire provider reports
  AUTH_REQUIRED and stays idle.
- AUTH_REQUIRED — AISStream needs an API key; the maritime provider is off by default and
  its commercial terms are still under review.
- LICENSE_REVIEW_REQUIRED — 18 providers are marked conditional and 9 manual-review in
  `config/licenses/providers.json`; they are off by default until legal sign-off
  (docs/legal/COMMERCIAL-DISTRIBUTION-REVIEW.md, blockers LR-01…LR-19).
- Offline 3D terrain is ellipsoid only: no legally clear terrain source is bundled, so a
  3D view offline shows a smooth globe. Offline 2D is a full PMTiles map (ADR-007).
- No basemap is bundled in a worldpack by default — you supply a PMTiles extract
  (docs/OFFLINE-PACKS.md §5). Packs built without one report `localMap: false` honestly.
- Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles are an optional adapter that needs your own key; they
  are never the default and never cached.
- OpenSky is not shipped: its licence is non-commercial (docs/legal/DATA-SOURCE-LICENSES.md).
- NWS zone-only alerts (no polygon) are skipped; most real alerts are zone-based, so
  alert coverage is partial until zone geometry resolution lands.
- RTSP cameras need the optional go2rtc sidecar, which the operator installs separately;
  MJPEG, HLS and JPEG snapshot cameras work without it.
- Worldpacks are integrity-checked but not signed; install packs you trust.
- deck.gl is not used: the native adapters meet the performance targets, and a second
  renderer would add risk without evidence (ADR-008).
- The satellite propagator uses satellite.js SGP4; positions are propagated from the
  cached element set and are not a substitute for an operational catalogue.
- History defaults to the NDJSON backend when the DuckDB native module is unavailable;
  the fallback and its reason are shown in Diagnostics.
